# Job Hunt Scraper

Job searching is hard :(

Hopefully this can help, even just a little!

## What it does

### Company careers page
Can scrape all listings on company career page (link and job title). Can have search and/or exclude words. Only works if all listings are on one page.
### Individual job postings
Can scrape an individual job posting for key data (job title, location, years of experience required). Currently suitable for most postings on greenhouse.io and lever.co.

## How to use it
Command line interface. Run `python3 main.py` and follow prompts given.

Most importantly, hope for the best :D
